# SFUISE (Spline Fusion-Based Ultra-Wideband-Inertial State Estimation)
## -- Continuous-Time Ultra-Wideband-Inertial Fusion
### News 
* 2024-04: We have moved the official code repository of SFUISE to here under the newly established group [ASIG](https://kailaili.github.io/). We will continue to maintain and release related code within this repository. Stay tuned with our progress!  
Note the previous code [repository](https://github.com/KIT-ISAS/SFUISE) is **no longer** being maintained since the maintainers has no accessibility to it any more.

## Introduction
This is the code repository of SFUISE, the first online continuous-time UWB-inertial state estimation system in ROS. Quaternion-based cubic B-splines are exploited to represent states continuously over time with efficient solutions to time derivatives and spatial differentiations in closed form. The functional core of the system is a novel sliding-window spline fitting scheme that is equipped with a customized implementation of LM method.

The system supports UWB-inertial fusion for both ToA and TDoA principles of ultra-wideband ranging with minimized external dependencies. See below for usage of SFUISE using public and our own recorded data sets. Detailed information about the system can be found in our paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09033) or [IEEE](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2023.3281932), and demonstrated on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9bbcskwPnw).

The work has been publlished on IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).

## Dependency
System dependencies (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
* [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) (tested with Noetic)
* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (tested with Eigen 3.3.7)
* [SuiteSparse](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
## Compilation
Compile with [catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/KIT-ISAS/SFUISE
cd ..
catkin build sfuise
```
## Usage
Run following commands in terminal
* Example for running sfuise on [UTIL](https://utiasdsl.github.io/util-uwb-dataset/) (TDoA-inertial):
```
# Change anchor_path in config_test_util.yaml
roslaunch sfuise sfuise_test_util.launch
rosbag play const1-trial1-tdoa2.bag
```
* Example for running sfuise on [ISAS-Walk](https://github.com/KIT-ISAS/SFUISE/tree/main/dataset) (ToA-inertial, own data set):
```
roslaunch sfuise sfuise_test_isas-walk1.launch
rosbag play ISAS-Walk1.bag
```
